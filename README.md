# discord.bat
the BEST discord lib

***

# Examples
## Config/config.bat
```batch
:: Bot Config
set bot.token=token_here
set bot.id=123456789012345678
set bot.prefix=$
set bot.playing=Hello World!

:: Event Config
set events.message.notification=1
```
Currently `bot.playing` and `bot.id` aren't used for anything, however, they are considered global variables.

## Config/commands.bat
```batch
if %1 neq "" call:%~1
goto exit

:help
call s.bat dmAuthor "Commands: $help, $ping, $info"
goto:eof

:ping
call s.bat sendMessage "Pong"
goto:eof

:info
call s.bat sendMessage "Made using `discord.bat` (Yes, it's real)"
goto:eof

:exit
```
Do **NOT** modify the first 2 or last line.

# How?
The way discord.bat works is you "code" in batch and it connects in discord.net, when it recieves a message/evemt it sends it to `eventManager.bat` with 2 arguments, the type of event and info about the event, so a message event would be `eventManager.bat message "$ping"` then it sends the event info into the message event function which checks for the prefix, then if it finds the prefix, removes it and sends it forward to `commands.bat` which you code in the Config folder and has all the code that you'll be writing. It just calls the function blindly like `call:ping` which (if you have it written in) calls the ping function, in the function, you have `call s.bat sendMessage "Pong!"` which calls the sendMessage function in the s.bat file, and it writes an interaction command into `update.dat`, so basically, it just makes the file and adds `sendPong` to it, while in the .net script, it waits 100ms for the file to exist and checks if it exists, if it does it checks what the command is, so, because we made it say `sendPong` it will remove the send as it knows that it will be sending the other characters and sends `Pong` to the same channel as the original message.
